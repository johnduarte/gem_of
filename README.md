# gem_of
Gem testing gems, rake tasks

Gemfiles are typically used solely for gems in development and testing. Are you tired of copypastaing the same Gems and rake tasks around to various projects, only to have to update them all later?

use the gem_of gems!

we bring you:

rake, rototiller, rspec, rubocop, simplecov, yardstick, markdown, flay, flog, roodi, rubycritic, and coveralls for all your dev and unit testing needs.

we bring you: beaker for your system testing needs, AND we ensure the bundle will install consistently across ruby versions by pinning old dependencies that don't seem to like following semver rules.

later we'll supply a bunch of canned rake tasks to bring this all together from the CLI or CI (see our Rakefile)

## locally install this gem
you can't put this in your Gemfile, because we need to use it to form your Gemfile
```
gem install --local gem_of
```
or:
```
clone git@github.com:puppetlabs/gem_of.git
cd gem_of
bundle install
bundle exec rake gem:build
bundle exec rake gem:install:local
```

## In your Gemfile
```
require 'gem_of'

eval(GemOf::Gems.new, binding)
```

## In your Rakefile
gem_of distributes itself into your Gemfile, so if it's installed locally, as above, then the bundle for your other project will have it, and the rake tasks:
```
require "gem_of/rake_tasks"

GemOf::RakeTasks.new
```
